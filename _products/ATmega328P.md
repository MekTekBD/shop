description_markdown: >-

    #### DESCRIPTION:
   The ATmega328P is a low-power CMOS 8-bit microcontroller based on the AVRenhanced RISC architecture. By executing powerful instructions in a single clock cycle, the ATmegaPA/328P achieves throughputs approaching 1 MIPS per MHz allowing the systemdesigner to optimize power consumption versus processing speed.
