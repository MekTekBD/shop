    #### DESCRIPTION: <br/>
      The 2N2218 is silicon planar epitaxial NPN transistors in Jedec TO-39 (for 2N2218 and 2N2219) and in Jedec TO-18 (for 2N2221 and 2N2222) metal cases.It is designed for high-speed switching applications at collector currents up to 500 mA, and feature useful current gain over a wide range of collector current,low leakage currents and low saturation voltages. <br/> <br/>

    #### SPECIFICATION: <br/>
      * Collector-base Voltage (IE = 0) 60 V <br/>
      * Collector-emitter Voltage (IB = 0) 30 V <br/>
      * Emitter-base Voltage (IC = 0) 5 V <br/>
      * Collector Current 0.8 A <br/>
